In order to create an interface that a player or AI could use to control the game, we'd have
to make a controller.

Our controller class would take in a readable and appendable, and use these to play the game.

It would run the appendable (which would be a list of the user's commands) through a 'playgame' function,
which would contain a switch case containing various commands needed to play the game.

Commands (x = number):
P - Pass your turn
MC X X - Move a card from your hand to a row and column.


It would cycle through the appendable, playing out the commands, until both players pass their turn,
in which case the game would end.

When we create an AI, the strategy it would implement would be checking each board space to determine
which one would have the most influence if a specific card was placed upon it.
